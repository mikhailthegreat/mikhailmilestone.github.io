		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p class="p-culture" id="intro-culture">
				The culture of Indonesia (Indonesian: Budaya Indonesia) has been shaped by the interplay of indigenous customs and diverse foreign influences. With over 600 distinct ethnic groups, including significant Austronesian and Melanesian cultures, contributing to its rich traditions, languages, and customs, Indonesia is a melting pot of diversity. 
				Positioned along ancient trade routes between the Far East, South Asia, and the Middle East, the country has absorbed cultural practices influenced by Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam, and Christianity. 
				These influences have created a complex cultural tapestry that often differs from the original indigenous cultures.
				Examples of the fusion of Islam with Hinduism include Javanese Abangan belief. 
				Balinese dances have stories about ancient Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms, while Islamic art forms and architecture are present in Sumatra, especially in the Minangkabau and Aceh regions. 
				Traditional art, music and sport are combined in a martial art form called Pencak Silat.
				The Western world has influenced Indonesia in science, technology and modern entertainment such as television shows, film and music, as well as political system and issues. 
				India has notably influenced Indonesian songs and movies. 
				A popular type of song is the Indian-rhythmical dangdut, which is often mixed with Arabic, Javanese and Malay folk music.
				Despite the influences of foreign culture, some remote Indonesian regions still preserve uniquely indigenous culture. 
				Indigenous ethnic groups Batak, Nias, Mentawai, Asmat, Dani, Sumba, Dayak, Toraja and many others are still practising their ethnic rituals, customs and wearing traditional clothes.
				Indonesia currently holds sixteen items of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage, including wayang puppet theatre, kris, batik, education and training in Indonesian batik, angklung, saman dance, noken, three genres of traditional Balinese dance, pinisi ship, pencak silat, gamelan, jamu, and reog. 
				Additionally, pantun, kebaya, and kolintang were inscribed through joint nominations.

		<h2>Art and Architecture</h2>
			<p class="p-culture" id="art-culture">
				Indonesian arts include both age-old art forms developed through centuries and recently developed contemporary art. 
				Indonesian arts have absorbed foreign influences—most notably from India, the Arab world, China, and Europe—due to contacts and interactions facilitated, and often motivated by trade.
				Painting is an established and developed art in Bali, where its people are famed for their artistry. 
				Their painting tradition started as classical Kamasan or Wayang style visual narrative, derived from visual art discovered on candi bas reliefs in eastern Java.
				The most dominant has traditionally been Indian; however, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also been significant. 
				Traditional carpentry, masonry, stone, and woodwork techniques and decorations have thrived in vernacular architecture, with numbers of traditional houses' (rumah adat) styles that have been developed. 
				The traditional houses and settlements vary by ethnic group, and each has a specific custom and history.
				Examples include Toraja's Tongkonan, Minangkabau's Rumah Gadang and Rangkiang, Javanese-style Pendopo pavilions with Joglo-style roofs, Dayak's longhouses, various Malay houses, Balinese houses and temples, and also different forms of rice barns (lumbung).
				There have been numerous discoveries of megalithic sculptures in Indonesia. Subsequently, tribal art has flourished within the culture of Nias, Batak, Asmat, Dayak, and Toraja. 
				Wood and stone are common materials used as the media for sculpting among these tribes. Between the 8th and 15th centuries, the Javanese civilisation developed refined stone sculpting art and architecture influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilisation. 
				The temples of Borobudur and Prambanan are among the most famous examples of the practice.

			<h2>Music, Dance, and Drama </h2>
				<p class="p-music">
					Indonesia’s culture of music, dance, and drama reflects its rich diversity, blending traditional and modern influences. 
					Traditional music includes ensembles like the Javanese and Balinese gamelan, known for its metallophones, gongs, and flutes, as well as the angklung, a bamboo instrument recognized by UNESCO, and the unique sasando from Rote Island. 
					Dance is equally varied, with classical styles like Java’s elegant bedhaya and Bali’s intricate legong, alongside vibrant folk dances such as Saman, a synchronized Acehnese performance. 
					Drama often intertwines with these art forms in shadow puppetry (wayang kulit) and traditional theater (like ludruk and ketoprak), which combine storytelling, music, and movement to depict epic tales and social themes. 
					Together, these art forms form a cornerstone of Indonesia’s cultural identity, blending the sacred, the ceremonial, and the entertaining.
