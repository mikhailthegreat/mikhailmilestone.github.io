                Hi! I'm Mikhail Arziki Jamil! I was born on the 26th of April 2009, in Jakarta. I'm currently in 10th Grade, in Senior HS. 
                I live in Tangerang Selatan, Indonesia. People say I'm a bit of a goofball, and I'm proud of it! Some of my favourite pastimes 
                are playing football, playing games, and especially reading books!
